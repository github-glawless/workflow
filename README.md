Ticket Prices Exercise

1 pt

Create a program that creates a ticket for a user.

    If the user is a senior citizen of 65 years or older, they receive a discounted price of $10/ticket.
    If the user is 12 years old or younger, they receive a discounted price of $8/ticket.
    Otherwise, the full price of a ticket is $14.

Age 	Price
0-12 	$8
13-64 	$14
65+ 	$10

Add the following to your program that prints the ticket prices for a user:

    Create a new variable named isStudent that is a boolean.
    Add another condition that checks if isStudent is true.
    If a user is a student, the user gets the same price as a user who is 12 years old or younger.
    Add a condition that throws an exception for negative age values.
    Add a try/catch block the catches the exception that is thrown.

Once your application compiles, add it to a public GitHub repository and paste the link below.
That’s the end! When you’re ready, submit this assessment at the top of the page.
